Three systems: -
1. OMM Engine: Quoting (Making and Taking) and Hedging system
2. LOB Interface: Exchange supporting various order types and order fills/matching
3. MM Agents: Other market participants interacting with LOB
    a. These agents are adveserial and try to leave no opportunity unturned in the market
    b. Each individual agent can help take away one opportunity/edge at a time
    c. E.g. Agressive Takers, Latency Arbitrageurs
    d. Liquidity Providers with different risk tolerance

Market evolution: -
    -> Layer 1: Latent/Hidden Mkt State: Markov Regime, GBM, OU (more like a fair value pricer)
    -> Layer 2: Order flow generator: Agents consume them and decide order flow (lo/mo, kills, hidden)
        Depends on Latent State, LOB and trades.
